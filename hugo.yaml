    content: |-
      I’m a machine learning engineer, musician, and creative problem-solver passionate about developing transformative technologies in the field of music. I’m currently pursuing a master’s in Sound and Music Computing at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, building on my machine learning foundation from Cornell University to explore state-of-the-art music information retrieval methods.  
      
      My research focuses on how the brain encodes music and how musical enculturation shapes perception and preferences. I also work on exploring machine learning methods for intuitive musical data management. I aim to build technologies that contribute to a more intuitive, ethical and equitable landscape for artist discoverability.
      
      With +4 yrs of professional experience in corporate financial modeling and advanced analytics at Goldman Sachs, I built strong technical expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization, as well as business acumen to navigate complex stakeholder, and legal environments.  
      
      I’m also a performing musician with experience in studio production, live performance, composition, and arrangement across genres. This dual perspective fuels my drive to contribute meaningfully to the field of music information retrieval research.
